the target user profile for this web is any inteligent species that want to know a bit more of info about Kit Fisto and his work.

Visual desing:
	I went for a web divided in four main sections: NAME, photo and contat information, other archives about him and the rest of the information.
	The backround is basicly black for dark screen user friendliness, and the text and details are in a pale green (green like him) and a purple which goes well in contrast.
